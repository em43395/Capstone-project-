Capstone: Package Delivery Optimization

This project is my Computer Science Capstone at Western Governors University. It demonstrates skills in Python development, algorithms, and data analysis through the design of a package delivery optimization system that improves efficiency in last-mile logistics.

ðŸ”¹ Project Summary

I designed and implemented a Python program that simulates a delivery companyâ€™s operations. The system optimizes package routing, minimizes total mileage, and ensures on-time deliveries. Results are supported with data analysis and visualizations to highlight efficiency improvements.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Optimized Routing & Scheduling: Algorithms that reduce delivery mileage while meeting deadlines.

Data Processing: Integration of package and distance data from CSV files.

Performance Analysis: Comparative metrics for baseline vs. optimized delivery times.

Visualization: Graphs generated for mileage, truck utilization, and delivery distribution.

ðŸ”¹ Skills Highlighted

Python programming (OOP, file handling, algorithms)

Data structures & algorithm design for optimization

Data analysis with CSV and visualization libraries

Applied problem-solving in logistics and operations research

Professional project documentation and communication

ðŸ”¹ Notes

This project was completed as part of the WGU Computer Science Capstone (C964) and represents the culmination of my bachelorâ€™s program. It highlights practical skills in backend development, algorithms, and applied computer science concepts.
